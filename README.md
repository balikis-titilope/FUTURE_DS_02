# 📊 Campaign Performance Analysis Dashboard  

This project is part of **Task 2** of my internship at **Future Intern**. The goal was to design an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that analyzes marketing campaign performance, focusing on spend, revenue, ROI, CTR, and conversion rates.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Marketing teams often run multiple campaigns across industries, regions, and platforms. To evaluate performance effectively, it’s crucial to:  
- Track **spend vs. revenue**  
- Measure **ROI** by industry, region, and campaign type  
- Understand the **audience journey** from impressions → clicks → conversions  
- Compare the effectiveness of **Digital vs. Traditional campaigns**  

This dashboard provides a **comprehensive view** of these metrics in one place.  


## 📌 Key Features  
- **KPI Cards** → Total Spend, Total Revenue, ROI %, CTR %, Conversion Rate %  
- **Engagement Funnel** → Visualizing drop-offs across Impressions, Clicks, and Conversions  
- **Regional Analysis** → Revenue vs Spend across regions + ROI by region  
- **Industry Insights** → ROI performance comparison across different industries  
- **Campaign Type Comparison** → Digital vs Traditional campaign performance  
- **ROI Deep Dive** → Highlighting campaigns delivering ROI above 70% 

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** → Data modeling, DAX calculations, interactive visualizations  
- **Excel / CSV Data** → Raw campaign data used for analysis  
- **Data Cleaning** → Handling nulls, formatting, and ensuring consistency  

## 🔑 Insights Gained  
- ROI varies significantly across industries, with **Finance** campaigns performing best.  
- **Africa and North America** showed the highest ROI by region.  
- Only a few campaigns delivered ROI above 70%, highlighting optimization opportunities.  
- Digital campaigns outperformed traditional campaigns in ROI contribution.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Apply a more refined visual design for better readability.  
- Add time-series analysis to track campaign trends over months/quarters.  
- Introduce predictive modeling for ROI forecasting.
